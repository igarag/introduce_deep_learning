# Learning machine learning

In this repository will be added exercises, practices and theory about machine learning and deep learning.

For a better understanding, the Jupyter environment will be used, which allows step-by-step execution of the program by adding theory.

- Machine Learning.
- Deep Learning.
- Reinforcement Learning.

## The library

### Machine Learning

- [Basic notebooks](https://github.com/correaleyval/ML-Notebooks).
- [Basic Libraries for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
- [Tutorial Sklean](https://github.com/pagutierrez/tutorial-sklearn) (Spanish).

### Computer Vision

## Installation

### Jupyter

If you have Python 3 installed (which is recommended):

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

If you have Python 2 installed:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```

To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (*Mac/Linux*) or Command Prompt (*Windows*):

```
jupyter notebook
```
